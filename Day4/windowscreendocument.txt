Window:
  The JavaScript Window object sits at the top of the JavaScript object hierarchy and represents
the browser Window. The window object is supported by all browsers. All global JavaScript object,
functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. The window is the first
things that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like
length, inner width, inner Height,name, if it has been closed, its parents and more.
 The window object represents the current browsing context.it holds things like location,history,
screen,window.status or the window.document. each browser tab has its own top-level window object.
each of these windows gets its own separate  global object.

Document:
  The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point
 into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree. when an HTML document is loaded into a web
 browser, it becomes a document object. It is the root node of the HTML document. The document
 actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title,URL,
 cookie, etc. HTML documents, served with "text/html" content type, also implement the HTML
 document interface, whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XML document interface.
