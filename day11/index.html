        <h3>VISUAL CREATIVITY</h3>
        <p>
          there,s more visual freedom in parallax web design. Rather than
          focusing on block style information architecture, tou can create
          refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful
          photography, that act as a continuum, ultimately inspiring users to
          scroll further down the page

        <p>
          Do you want to tell a story with your product or service?
          Long-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative and encourages
          meaningful interaction from users.

          Mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. It’s
          now less about clicking and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping.
          Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation,
          providing a responsive, user-friendly experience for mobile users.

        <p>
          Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor website
          browsers, as it forces businesses to convey their message and vision
          into one dynamic web design page.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          These days, scrolling is so simple that it’s become an instinctive
          action, whereas clicking through to another page requires thought and
          motivation. A single page website allows user to identify their
          purpose on the website quicker, than needing to sift through multiple
          pages.

        <h3>YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVVY</h3>
        <p>
          One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that they
          are not SEO friendly. Why? When you limit the number of pages on your
          website, Google has fewer pages to index and negatively impacts your
          standing on the search engine results page (SERP). Luckily there are
          ways around this.
        </p>

        <div class="box">
          <h1>S</h1>
          <span>LOWER LOAD TIMES</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn’t loaded in 3-5
          seconds. So the more high resolution imagery and animations you
          include, the longer it takes to load the page. When writing this
          article, we tested some popular parallax websites, and found that the
          ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to load on a mobile
          device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites loaded
          within a few seconds.

          <h1>A</h1>
          <span>WKWARD NAVIGATION</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Instead of hitting the “back” button, users must scroll back up the
          page which can be frustrating for users who want to refer back to a
          certain element. An easy way around this is to include top navigation
          and have each element anchored to a category or section.
